# NeoGary
A role-managing Discord bot written in C#

This bot aims to replace [Gary](https://github.com/thev0rtex/gary), with fewer, more focused features and a less complex configuration system.

# Dependencies

* .NET Core 2.1
* MySQL

# Setup

Head over to [the database repo](https://github.com/monodokimes/neogary-db) and follow the instructions there to set up a MySQL database for the bot.

Create a Discord application for the bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers) and invite the bot to your server. Currently the bot can only be invited to one server at a time.

Fill out the configuration file and run the bot.
